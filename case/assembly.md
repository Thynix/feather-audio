## Assembly Notes

1. Put the encoder in before anything else because the OLED board pins would block it otherwise.
2. Put right transducer's wires (it's on the left when viewed from the back as when connecting it) in the bottom terminal blocks on the MusicMaker because they have farther to go to reach the terminal blocks.
2. Don't completely tighten the outer transducer screws until the bottom is seated into the body because they're liable to exceed the bottom and intrude on/push the body. Once it's seated it may be okay to tighten.
